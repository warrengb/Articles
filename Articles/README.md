&emsp;&emsp;
Blazor Typescript Interop is an elegant way to interface your Blazor C# WebAssembly (Wasm).  
With the browsers JavaScript API and JavaScript libraries.  
Interop is neccessary because Wasm can't reach outside the browser security sandbox.   
As there is no direct communication between Wasm and the browser JavaScript API.  
This article starts with JavaScript interop then progresses to TypeScript interop.
